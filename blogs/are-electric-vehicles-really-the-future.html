        <div class="blog-meta">August 2023 · By Kartheek Reddy</div>
        <article class="prose prose-invert prose-lg">
          <p>Transportation serves as a pillar of modern society, having evolved significantly over time. From the era of steam power, we changed to conventional fossil fuels, and now, electricity powers our vehicles. In response to increasing environmental concerns and the urgency of addressing global warming, a shift toward a more dependable and sustainable energy source has become a priority.</p>
          <p>In recent times, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising alternative to internal combustion engines, notorious for emitting detrimental greenhouse gases. This transformation has led governments, industries, and individuals to believe EVs as the only option of a more ecologically conscious future, predominantly reliant on electricity as their energy source.</p>
          <p>However, this view doesn't cover the entire truth. As the world embarks on a path toward environmental protection, it is crucial to completely understand the multiple problems of EVs on our ecosystem. This study dives into the intricate landscape of vehicle manufacturing, energy sourcing, and a in-depth look at data and statistics. Its primary objective is to scrutinize the authenticity of EVs as a feasible mode of transportation in the context of global sustainability.</p>
          <h2>Energy Sources for Electric Vehicles</h2>
          <p>The main source of energy for electric vehicles is use electricity. They use Direct Current (DC) to store in their batteries and to drive. However, their main source of electricity is the main grid which is Alternating Current (AC). Therefore, most electric vehicles have an integrated onboard charger which converts the oncoming AC to DC.</p>
          <p>Along with the main grid as their primary source of energy, they also rely on regenerative braking, which converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle into DC and recharge the battery during deceleration.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, the main source of energy for EVs is the main grid. And the major source of electricity in the main grid is trough combustion of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. In 2022, about 4,243 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity were generated at utility scale electricity generation facilities in the United States of which about 60% of this electricity was from fossil fuels.</p>
          <p>Coal and natural gases are the major sources of electricity which are also a major contributors of greenhouse gases. Lower grade coal like Lignite and Sub-bituminous are widely used for energy production as they are abundantly available but are a serious threat to the environment. Their calorific value is low and release poisons gases like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide which are the cause for the phenomenon called acid rains.</p>
          <p>In India around 80% of its energy comes from fossil fuels like coal, petroleum and biomass. The rise of energy consumption in major cities like Delhi cause the city to generate more electricity from the coal power plants around Delhi which significantly decreased its air quality to an average of 219 (AQI of New York is 53) making it one of the most air polluted cities in the world.</p>
          <p>Now as many more EVs joining every day, the total energy consumption is going to increase more prompting to overload the existing power plants thus deteriorating the air quality further unless sustainable energy choices are made.</p>
          <h2>Hazardous materials in batteries</h2>
          <p>Electric vehicles draw their primary power from grids while storing energy in their batteries. Major EV manufacturers like Tesla and Lucid rely on lithium-ion batteries, capable of storing significant energy and enduring prolonged use. Nevertheless, these batteries contain hazardous components such as lithium, cadmium, and nickel. The mining of these elements already exerts a considerable environmental damage, and the subsequent refining process amplifies these impacts.</p>
          <p>For instance, consider nickel. It is commonly obtained from sulfide ores, known as laterite. This acquisition process involves reagent mixing, leaching, and smelting. Unfortunately, the byproduct of this refining often produces sulfur, which poses a significant environmental threat.</p>
          <p>However, the challenges do not conclude here. As a matter of fact, batteries experience a decline in capacity with each charging cycle, eventually needing to replace them. So, what happens to these discarded batteries? Recycling, you might think, but the reality is more complex. Around 99% of lead-based batteries are recycled, while astonishingly, just 5% of lithium-ion batteries employed in EVs receive the same treatment. This raises the question: where does the remaining 95% go? Regrettably, it either heads to landfills or disappears unaccounted for.</p>
          <p>Battery recycling presents a dilemma. Crafting an entirely new battery is often economically more viable than recycling an existing one. Furthermore, the lack of established recycling techniques and guidelines for handling these toxic metals contributes to the problem. The ecological and economic imbalance between recycling and manufacturing new batteries underscores the need for innovative recycling solutions and sustainable practices in the EV industry.</p>

          <h2>Also, a possible fire hazard</h2>
          <p>In recent weeks, there has been a surge in reported incidents involving electric vehicles catching fire, tragically resulting in the loss of lives. This issue appears to be particularly frequent among mopeds and budget cars. The question that arises is: what factors contribute to these incidents?</p>
          <p>The underlying causes primarily is from bad manufacturing practices and environmental conditions. These vehicles often utilize cost-effective batteries, some of which originate from Chinese manufacturers. Unfortunately, these batteries tend to fail considerably short of established safety standards and are characterized by substandard construction.</p>
          <p>Adding to the complexity is the operational temperature range of lithium-ion batteries, which typically spans from -20°C to 60°C. Beyond these thresholds, the batteries can experience a decline in performance. In the case of budget-friendly batteries, consequences can be worse. Elevated temperatures during the summer months coupled with humidity levels can trigger circuit malfunctions, potentially leading to circuitry melting and combustion.</p>
          <p>Inadequacies in power converters represent another contributing factor. The process of converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) generates notable heat. When power converters are poorly constructed, this heat can increase to the point of melting and, in extreme cases, igniting. A malfunctioning voltage regulator can further exacerbate the situation, causing batteries to be overcharged, thus culminating in the risk of explosion.</p>
          <p>In the end, a combination of factors ranging from the quality of battery manufacturing to operational conditions and power management intricacies underscores the reasons behind the concerning instances of EVs catching fire.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>As the world undertakes a collective journey towards environmental preservation, it becomes crucial to thoroughly assess the multifaceted repercussions of electric vehicles on our ecosystem. In tandem, manufacturers and companies ought to dedicate their efforts to devising sustainable methodologies for the production of these vehicles. In this pursuit, exploring superior alternatives to prevailing practices becomes imperative, alongside the development of cleaner energy sources. Equally vital is the imposition of more stringent regulations and guidelines by governments concerning the manufacture of electric vehicles. Until these critical strides are realized, electric vehicles remain a mere mode of transportation rather than a genuinely sustainable solution.</p>
